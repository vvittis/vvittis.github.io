                In a streaming context, machine learning is a more of a challenge, because incoming data cannot be stored and may change over time.
                Therefore, we have to create such algorithms that pass of the data once and extract the most information out of it.
                <br><br>
                <!-- &emsp; -->
                In my thesis there is a streaming Random Forest or else an ensemble of Hoeffding Trees (HT), using the distributed engine of Apache
                Flink. It handles numerical attributes by efficiently modeling them with Gaussian Approximation, and it uses the SVFDT-II algorithm to
                cope with potential cluster restrictions by setting stricter splitting rules. Also, my thesis considers concept (-distribution) drift,
                where I used the DDM algorithm.
                <br><br>
                My main contribution is a new experimental proposition of disengaging HT growth from the amount of incoming data, and a new way of
                consistent, highly reliable query answering system, that guarantees the minimum possible error-rate in periods of abrupt concept
                drift.

                In this study we explored the robustness of different machine learning algorithms for the classification of
                NPSLE patients and healthy control subjects using resting-state fMRI connectivity indices.
                Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, which is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder,
                involves a wide range of focal and diffuse central and peripheral nervous system symptoms.

                Machine Learning applications on clinical data may enhance the existing workflow for NPSLE classification as there
                is no established method of applying neuroimaging data to the diagnosis of NPSLE. We evaluated different
                ML algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Na√Øve Bayesian and
                Random Forest in order to achieve this goal. Feature selection or reduction methods were applied prior to
                the classification process. The Connectivity Matrix used consisted of pairwise regional functional
                associations of the fMRI signals within each of three predetermined brain networks in 31 NPSLE patients
                and 31 healthy control subjects. Optimal, cross-validated classification accuracy was obtained using
                Random Forest (77%) followed by SVM and NB methods (74%). Results demonstrate the potential for the future implementation of similar
                methods in the diagnosis of NPSLE.

            <a class="notes" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vvittis/FlinkSampling">Code</a>

            <p style="text-align: justify">

                This is a project implementing <a class="notes" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02629.pdf">Random Sampling for
                Group-By Queries</a> at Apache Flink Platform. The goal of this project is to sample
                streaming tuples, answering effectively Single Aggregate along with a single group-by clause. This implementation is a two-pass
                algorithm which is divided into two phases. The first phase has been taken from the first job (pre-processing) and the second phase
                from the second job (reservoir sampling). The program prints per stratum:
            <ul>
                <li>Its average</li>
                <li>The standard deviation</li>
                <li>The sample size</li>
                <li>The tuples of the sample</li>
