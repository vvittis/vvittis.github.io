                In a streaming context, machine learning is a more of a challenge, because incoming data cannot be stored and may change over time.
                Therefore, we have to create such algorithms that pass of the data once and extract the most information out of it.
                <br>
                <!-- &emsp; -->
                In my thesis there is a streaming Random Forest or else an ensemble of Hoeffding Trees (HT), using the distributed engine of Apache
                Flink. It handles numerical attributes by efficiently modeling them with Gaussian Approximation, and it uses the SVFDT-II algorithm to
                cope with potential cluster restrictions by setting stricter splitting rules. Also, my thesis considers concept (-distribution) drift,
                where I used the DDM algorithm.
                <br>
                My main contribution is a new experimental proposition of disengaging HT growth from the amount of incoming data, and a new way of
                consistent, highly reliable query answering system, that guarantees the minimum possible error-rate in periods of abrupt concept
                drift.

            <a class="notes" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vvittis/CCFD-RF">Code</a>

                This is a project implementing a real-time fraud-detection system (FDS) for Credit Card Fraud Transactions using Adaptive Random Forest in Apache Spark platform. The
                increasing use of credit card in online transactions reflects the rise of a new, fast and easy way of interchange in modern world. Based on extensive data collected for online card
                payments in the United Kingdom, is expected that by 2026, the number of card payments per day will grow to 60 million.[1] This new form of transaction involves the risk of fraudulent
                attacks and fishing attempts, therefore provokes the urgent need of developing fast and online FDS.
                <br>
                <!-- &emsp; -->
                This project suggests a new system for detecting and monitoring online transactions
                using the latest Apache Spark processing engine, Structured Streaming, and implementing an Adaptive Ensemble Classification Method, Random Forest. Our goal is to design a learner, for
                extremely large datasets which do not fit in main memory, adapting to concept drift and evolving data. We show the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real world datasets
                and we manage to reach a 92% accuracy on average.

            <a class="notes" target="_blank" href="docs/Evaluation%20of%20ML%20Algorithms%20for%20NPSLE%20classification.pdf">PDF</a>

                In this study we explored the robustness of different machine learning algorithms for the classification of
                NPSLE patients and healthy control subjects using resting-state fMRI connectivity indices.
                Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, which is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder,
                involves a wide range of focal and diffuse central and peripheral nervous system symptoms.

                <!-- &emsp; -->
                Machine Learning applications on clinical data may enhance the existing workflow for NPSLE classification as there
                is no established method of applying neuroimaging data to the diagnosis of NPSLE. We evaluated different
                ML algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Na√Øve Bayesian and
                Random Forest in order to achieve this goal. Feature selection or reduction methods were applied prior to
                the classification process. The Connectivity Matrix used consisted of pairwise regional functional
                associations of the fMRI signals within each of three predetermined brain networks in 31 NPSLE patients
                and 31 healthy control subjects. Optimal, cross-validated classification accuracy was obtained using
                Random Forest (77%) followed by SVM and NB methods (74%). Results demonstrate the potential for the future implementation of similar
                methods in the diagnosis of NPSLE.

                streaming tuples, answering effectively Single Aggregate along with a single group-by clause. This implementation is a two-pass
                algorithm which is divided into two phases. The first phase has been taken from the first job (pre-processing) and the second phase
                from the second job (reservoir sampling). The program prints per stratum:

                The PHP-Apache service is responsible for containing all .php files of the project. The fact that this service depends on the connected database signifies that the database(mysqli)
                service
                will start as soon as the website(php-apache) service will start. In this service I do not use a ready to use container, but I constructed our own DockerFile inside the php folder. In

                The MySQL is responsible for managing the database system of the project. This action serves that during the build of docker-compose up, the website will have an initialised database
                alongside by grabbing the school.sql and
                making it the starting point of the database.

                <!-- &emsp; -->
                The PhpMyAdmin service is optional but nonetheless necessary for visualization and better monitoring of the database. It's exposed port is 8080 for accessing externally and port 80 for
                internal communication with the php as we discussed previously.
